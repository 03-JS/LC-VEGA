## Description

VEGA is a sentient AI from the modern DOOM games that can assist you in many different ways through voice commands. You can ask him to do almost anything, and can even give you info about moons, creatures and a lot more.

## What can I ask VEGA to do?

VEGA is able to perform a very wide variety of actions. From disabling hazards, opening doors, to even giving you an Advanced Scanner that can detect nearby items and entities.

Here's the full list of all the things you can ask him to do:

### Moons
---
You can ask VEGA to give you information about any of the base game's moons with the following voice command:

- VEGA, info about [name of the moon]

### Creatures
---
You can ask VEGA to read out a creature's bestiary entry with the command:

- VEGA, read [creature's name] entry

You can also ask him to give you a summary of the creature by saying:

- VEGA, info about [creature's name]

### Advanced Scanner
---
VEGA is capable of adding two trackers to your helmet's display that will give you information on how many items and creatures are near you in real time, similarly to the ship's minimap. The item tracker doesn't just give you the number of nearby items however, it also displays how much they are worth in total. Also, items held by you or other players do not get tracked by the Advanced Scanner.

To activate the Advanced Scanner, use the following command:

- VEGA, activate scanner / enable scanner / turn on scanner / activate advanced scanner / enable advanced scanner / scan

To disable it, you can just say:

- VEGA, disable scanner / turn off scanner / disable advanced scanner / turn off advanced scanner / disable scan

### Secure doors
---
VEGA can open and close the closest secure door to you with the following commands:

- VEGA, open secure door / open door / open the door / open the secure door
- VEGA, close secure door / close door / close the door / close the secure door

Alternatively, you can also ask him to open or close all secure doors in the facility with these commands:

- VEGA, open all secure doors / open all doors
- VEGA, close all secure doors / close all doors

### Hazards
---
You can ask VEGA to disable the nearest turret, mine or spike trap with the following commands:

- VEGA, disable turret / disable the turret
- VEGA, disable the mine / disable mine / disable the landmine / disable landmine
- VEGA, disable the trap / disable trap / disable the spike trap / disable spike trap

And, as is the case with [Secure Doors](#secure-doors), he can also disable all mines, traps and turrets inside the facility with the following commands:

- VEGA, disable all turrets
- VEGA, disable all mines / disable all landmines
- VEGA, disable all traps / disable all spike traps

### Teleporter
---
VEGA is capable of using the ship's teleporter. To have him do so, you just have to say:

- VEGA, tp / teleport / activate tp / activate teleporter

I heavily recommend you always use the [Radar Switch](#radar-switch) command before asking him to use the teleporter if you aren't playing solo, as you could otherwise accidentally teleport someone else back to the ship.

### Radar Switch
---
VEGA can focus the ship's radar / cameras / minimap on you by saying:

- VEGA, focus / focus on me / switch to me / switch radar / switch radar to me

### Crew status
---
You can ask VEGA to give you a status report of your crew that tells you how many players are left with the following command:

- VEGA, crew status / team status / crew info / team info / crew report / team report

Here's an example of what it can look like:

## What can VEGA do by himself?

On his own, VEGA can:
- Let you know it's getting late when inside a moon's facility.
- Give you a brief and informative warning when taking out the Apparatus.
- When you scan a creature for the first time, he will give you a short summary about it, with some helpful tips on how to avoid / deal with them as well.
- Read bestiary entries out loud.
- Give you some information on the current weather of the moon you're going to as you are landing if you have 150 experience points or less.
